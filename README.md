# Question Tagger Codechef API Hackathon

`Tag. Track. Code. Improve`

### Question Tagger:
This is a multipurpose web app which one can use to tag and analyse his/her questions.

The key features of the web app are as follows:
 - `Tag Questions` - you can tag questions for your reference, so that you can practice questions of a particular tag later for improvement.

 - `Analyse Tags` - View all questions along with their submission status of the selected tag to gain insights of your ACs(accepted), WAs(wrong answer), TLEs(time limit exceeded), CTEs(compile time errors) and RTEs(run time error).

 - `Test Generator` - You can mark questions for improvement and can later create a practice test out of the questions available for improvement.

 - `View Submission Status` of Questions submitted during the mock test
